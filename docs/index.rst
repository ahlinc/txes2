txes2 - Elasticsearch client for Twisted
========================================

``txes2`` is a PyES-like Elasticsearch client for Twisted applications. ``txes2`` is a fork of `txes <https://github.com/jkoelker/txes>`_ with a more `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_-friendly interface. Credits are available at the project's `Contributors section <https://github.com/lextoumbourou/txes2#contributors>`_.

``txes2`` has the following goals:

* A clean, safe API for interacting with Elasticsearch using Twisted's deferred model.
* Support for all PyES features and more (in progress).
* 95% unit and integration test coverage (in progress).
* Excellent documentation coverage (in progress).
